# AI Scheduling Workflow Optimization

## Current Schema Assessment

### âœ… **Strengths**
- **Department-based qualification system** with `teacher_departments` table
- **Multi-layered validation** with course-level and offering-level constraints
- **Clear separation** between curriculum planning (`class_offerings`) and delivery (`scheduled_lessons`)
- **Comprehensive constraint system** with teacher time constraints
- **Academic year structure** with terms and proper date management

### ðŸ”§ **Critical Issues Fixed**
1. **Missing foreign key constraints** between `scheduled_lessons` and related tables
2. **No school_id in scheduled_lessons** for proper RLS and filtering
3. **Lack of performance indexes** for AI scheduling queries
4. **Missing data integrity constraints** for double-booking prevention
5. **No AI-specific helper functions** for efficient scheduling

## Optimized Workflow

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Admin Workflow)**
```

   â””â”€â”€ Define working days and holidays

3. Set Up Departments
   â”œâ”€â”€ Create academic departments

   â””â”€â”€ Define department descriptions

4. Create Courses
   â”œâ”€â”€ Assign to departments
   â”œâ”€â”€ Set grade levels
   â”œâ”€â”€ Define total hours per year
   â””â”€â”€ Configure term hour distribution

5. Add Teachers
   â”œâ”€â”€ Basic teacher information
   â”œâ”€â”€ Map to departments (primary + secondary)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Set max periods per week
   â””â”€â”€ Define time constraints

6. Create Classes
   â”œâ”€â”€ Define grade levels and sections
   â””â”€â”€ Set class names (e.g., "Grade 9-A")

7. Configure Time Slots
   â”œâ”€â”€ Define daily schedule
   â”œâ”€â”€ Set period numbers
   â””â”€â”€ Mark teaching vs non-teaching periods
```

### **Phase 2: Curriculum Planning (Admin Workflow)**
```
8. Create Class Offerings
   â”œâ”€â”€ Map courses to classes for specific terms
   â”œâ”€â”€ Set periods per week requirement
   â”œâ”€â”€ Define required hours per term
   â””â”€â”€ Validate against course total hours

9. Assign Teachers to Offerings
   â”œâ”€â”€ Manual assignment with qualification validation
   â”œâ”€â”€ AI-suggested assignments based on department mapping
   â””â”€â”€ Handle conflicts and preferences
```

### **Phase 3: AI Scheduling (System Workflow)**
```
10. Generate Timetable
    â”œâ”€â”€ Fetch curriculum requirements
    â”œâ”€â”€ Get available time slots
    â”œâ”€â”€ Apply teacher constraints
    â”œâ”€â”€ Optimize for curriculum coverage
    â””â”€â”€ Create scheduled lessons

11. Validate Schedule
    â”œâ”€â”€ Check for teacher conflicts
    â”œâ”€â”€ Verify curriculum coverage
    â”œâ”€â”€ Validate against constraints
    â””â”€â”€ Generate validation report
```

## AI Scheduling Algorithm Logic

### **Input Data Structure**
```sql
-- Get curriculum requirements for AI
SELECT * FROM get_curriculum_requirements(term_id, school_id);

-- Get available time slots for teacher
SELECT * FROM get_available_time_slots(teacher_id, date, school_id);
```

### **Scheduling Constraints**
1. **Hard Constraints (Must Satisfy)**
   - Teacher can only teach one class at a time
   - Lessons must be within term dates
   - Teacher must be qualified for the subject (department mapping)
   - Teacher time constraints (unavailable slots)

2. **Soft Constraints (Optimize For)**
   - Teacher preferences (preferred/avoid time slots)
   - Curriculum coverage (periods per week)
   - Teacher workload distribution
   - Subject distribution across the week

### **AI Scheduling Steps**
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Load all curriculum requirements
   - Calculate total periods needed per class
   - Identify qualified teachers per subject
   - Map teacher constraints

2. **Scheduling Algorithm**
   - Start with highest priority classes (core subjects)
   - For each class offering:
     - Find qualified teachers
     - Get available time slots
     - Assign periods based on constraints
     - Update availability

3. **Optimization**
   - Check for conflicts
   - Balance teacher workload
   - Optimize subject distribution
   - Validate curriculum coverage

4. **Validation**
   - Run validation functions
   - Generate conflict reports
   - Calculate coverage statistics

## Performance Optimizations

### **Database Indexes**
- `idx_scheduled_lessons_date_timeslot` - Fast date/time lookups
- `idx_teaching_assignments_teacher` - Quick teacher assignment queries
- `idx_time_slots_school_day` - Efficient time slot filtering
- `idx_class_offerings_term_class` - Curriculum requirement queries

### **Materialized Views**
- `schedule_summary` - Pre-computed schedule data for reporting
- Automatic refresh on schedule changes

### **Helper Functions**
- `get_available_time_slots()` - Efficient conflict checking
- `get_curriculum_requirements()` - Structured curriculum data
- `validate_schedule()` - Comprehensive validation
