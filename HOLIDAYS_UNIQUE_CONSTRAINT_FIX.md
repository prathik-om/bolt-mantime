# Critical Fix: Holidays Unique Constraint for Multi-School Support

## Issue Identified

**Problem**: The holidays table had a **regression** in its unique constraint that would prevent proper multi-school operation and OR-Tools integration.

### Original Problem
- **Incorrect Constraint**: `UNIQUE (school_id, date)` or `UNIQUE (academic_year_id, date)`
- **Impact**: Different schools or academic years could not have holidays on the same calendar date
- **OR-Tools Impact**: Ambiguous input data that could cause scheduling conflicts

### Real-World Scenario
Consider a multi-campus institution:
- **Campus A**: Has holiday on "2024-12-25" (Christmas)
- **Campus B**: Has holiday on "2024-12-25" (Christmas) 
- **Academic Year 2024**: Has holiday on "2024-12-25"
- **Academic Year 2025**: Has holiday on "2024-12-25"

With the old constraint, this would fail because the same date cannot be used multiple times.

## Solution Implemented

### Correct Constraint
```sql
UNIQUE (school_id, academic_year_id, date)
```

### Benefits
1. **Multi-School Support**: Different schools can have holidays on the same date
2. **Multi-Year Support**: Different academic years can have holidays on the same date
3. **OR-Tools Compatibility**: Unambiguous input data for scheduling algorithms
4. **Scalability**: Supports enterprise multi-campus deployments

### Migration Applied
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250625000029_fix_holidays_unique_constraint.sql`

**Key Changes**:
1. **Schema Migration**: Converted from `term_id` to `academic_year_id`
2. **Constraint Fix**: Applied correct unique constraint
3. **Validation Update**: Updated validation functions
4. **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript definitions

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. Database Schema
```sql
-- Before (INCORRECT)
UNIQUE (school_id, date)

-- After (CORRECT)
UNIQUE (school_id, academic_year_id, date)
```

#### 2. TypeScript Types
```typescript
// Before
holidays: {
  Row: {
    term_id: string  // ❌ Wrong relationship
    school_id: string
    date: string
  }
}

// After
holidays: {
  Row: {
    academic_year_id: string  // ✅ Correct relationship
    school_id: string
    date: string
  }
}
```

#### 3. Validation Logic
```typescript
// Before
.eq('school_id', data.school_id)
.eq('date', data.date)

// After
.eq('school_id', data.school_id)
.eq('academic_year_id', data.academic_year_id)
.eq('date', data.date)
```

## OR-Tools Integration Impact

### Before Fix
- **Ambiguous Data**: Same date could not be used across schools/years
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: OR-Tools would receive conflicting holiday data
- **Scalability Issues**: Limited to single-school deployments

### After Fix
- **Clear Data**: Each holiday is uniquely identified by school + year + date
- **Accurate Scheduling**: OR-Tools receives unambiguous holiday constraints
- **Enterprise Ready**: Supports complex multi-campus scenarios

## Validation

### Build Status
✅ **PASSED**: All TypeScript compilation successful
✅ **PASSED**: No type errors in validation functions
✅ **PASSED**: Database types correctly updated

### Migration Safety
- **Backward Compatible**: Handles existing data migration
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Rollback Ready**: Includes proper constraint management

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. ✅ **Migration Applied**: Run `20250625000029_fix_holidays_unique_constraint.sql`
2. ✅ **Types Updated**: Database types reflect new schema
3. ✅ **Validation Fixed**: Holiday validation uses correct fields
4. ✅ **Build Successful**: No TypeScript compilation errors
5. ✅ **Data Migration**: Existing holiday data properly migrated

## Critical Importance

This fix is **essential** for:
- **Production Deployment**: Multi-school environments
- **OR-Tools Accuracy**: Proper constraint modeling
- **Data Integrity**: Preventing scheduling conflicts
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade deployments

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**
